# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect fake news using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. The system analyzes textual data from news articles and classifies them as real or fake. The goal is to develop an accurate and efficient model to mitigate the spread of misinformation.

## Features
- Preprocessing of news data (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, etc.)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF and word embeddings
- Implementation of traditional machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
- Deep learning models using LSTM and CNN architectures
- Evaluation and comparison of different models

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled news articles. It includes both fake and real news samples for training and testing purposes.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NLTK
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Model Training and Evaluation
- Train machine learning models using the preprocessed dataset.
- Train deep learning models with embeddings.
- Evaluate models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess it.
2. Train the selected machine learning and deep learning models.
3. Evaluate and compare model performance.
4. Use the trained model for fake news classification.

## Results
- The results of the project include accuracy scores for various models.
- Deep learning models (LSTM) generally perform better than traditional machine learning models.

## Future Improvements
- Implement transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) for better accuracy.
- Use more diverse and larger datasets to improve model generalization.
- Optimize hyperparameters using advanced tuning techniques.
- Develop a web-based application or API for real-time fake news detection.
- Integrate additional NLP techniques such as sentiment analysis to enhance detection.
